    <h2>Twitter</h2>
      <p>During the 2016 presidential election, twitter bots were found to regularly post links to websites known for posting misleading misinformation. It was also found that "Unmasking the bots exposed how the automated accounts encourage people to disseminate misinformation. One strategy is to heavily promote a low-credibility article immediately after itâ€™s published, which creates the illusion of popular support and encourages human users to trust and share the post" (Temming) <br><br> Science news posted an article that can be accessed <a href = "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twitter-bots-fake-news-2016-election">here</a>, in which they discuss Filippo Menczer's full research on how twitter bots are able to contribute to the spread of fake news.</p>

    <h2>Social Media Bots</h2>
    <p>Social Media Bots are becoming far too common as time goes on and there. Before I get started explaining how bots work, I should by explaining a social media bot is essentially a coded social media account that will automatically and continuously complete specified tasks (<i>How Is Fake News Spread? Bots, People like You, Trolls, and Microtargeting, Center for Information Technology and Society - UC Santa Barbara</i>). <br><br>
    With that being said social media bots are incredibly effective at spreading fake news for a couple reasons:</p>

              <li><div class = "p1">They target people who will retweet what they say and will make it seen by the most people</div></li>
              <li><div class = "p1">They find fake news stories before most people know about them so it will be more believable.</div></li></p>
      </ul>
    </dd> 
    <p>These bots are incredibly difficult to detect by humans, but if you know what to look for, then it is possible to avoid a decent amount of it. The Pew Research Center has a great video on identifying twitter bots, (<i>which can be accessed by clicking the photo below</i>).

    <h2>Instagram</h2>
    <p>Instagram is another place where fake news is becoming a larger problem, and that is because it was found that "Disinformation is increasingly based on images as opposed to text"(McCammond). An article on Axios about fake news on instagram explained that because of the hashtag system and others of the sorts it is becoming much easier to put a photo anywhere for anyone to see regardless of the content, so it is easier to shar fake news.<br><br> If you click on the photo below you can read more on the intricies of Intsagram nad fake news in Alexi McCammond's article <a href =https://www.axios.com/new-fake-news-worry-for-instagram-64583147-3977-4b64-a0e8-a191872f60a4.html>New fake-news worry for Instagram</a></p><br><br><br><br>
