                    My name is Dean Fallas, and I am, obviously, a current RIT student. I am majoring in Game Design and Development and am looking into minors in either business or Psychology. My favorite games at the moment are the Borderlands series, the Monster Hunters series, and Fortnite. If I had to pick a favorite game series of all time it would probably be Pokemon.

                As far as growing up, I grew up in Oxford Connecticut. I enjoyed playing videogames, the ones I mentioned before, and playing baseball. I played baseball throughout the entirety of my life up until the end of highschool, and since graduating I have stopped playing. My favorite pass times include working out, as mentioned before playing video games, and trying new things. I try to put a lot of work in staying in shape and eating right and I especially enjoy helping people who want to start working out or eating right. I would like to learn more about this field in the future, but as of right now I do not really have the time. In my free time I enjoy watching videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube</a>, which is sadly too often.
