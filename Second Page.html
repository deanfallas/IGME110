        There is no denying that humans are smart creatures, however, sometimes we can be decieved by our own<br> bodies. Social media is able to take advantage of this contributing to the spreading of fake news.<br><br> Humans long to fit in and be part of a group, and social media sites allow this to happen with features that<br> allow us to people with similar interests to connect and talk. When you get a group of people like this together<br> it becomes much more likely that there will be bias in what stories get shared. This bias can become a problem <br> because there will be no one questioning what is being read and no one determining whether or not what you<br> are seeing is fake news or not. <br><br>The results of this can end up becoming dangerous too, one TEDEd discuessed both how fake news spreads<br> and gave a great example of how this had dangerous effects, mainly with a result of people not getting their kids<br> vaccinated.
